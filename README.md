# AMATH-482---Reports
## What is this project?
This repository is a collection of my blood, sweat, and ... more sweat that I put into coding. AMATH 482 is a upper-division Applied Mathematics covering mathematical tools used in data analysis. We covered topics such as Fourier transforms, spectrograms, and more. Every two weeks, we had a report due, and you can find the completed versions here. Each report features a different mathematical concept utilized for data analysis. 

## Why is this project important?
As an undergraduate studying Statistics, the only thing I was concerned about was building a model that accurately described data and/or predicted future observations. This class broadened my understanding and passion for data analysis by teaching me how other mathematical tools are being used to not only model the data, but represent, process, and transform data. This project is especially important to me in showing the potential of data science and how math and statistics form its backbone. The project features some of the coolest techniques hot in the market right now.

## How can you get started?
Due to restraints, I have not uploaded the files I used during assignments. However, due to openness of the assignments, one can easily use their own data. Every report features a theoretical section then a section on how to implement the algorithm. It should serve as a guide on how to do it oneself. 

## Where can users get help?
The report are the backbones of the my project. Please refer to them or if you attend the University of Washington, consider taking AMATH 482.

## Who maintains and contribute to this project?
I maintain the project. The original homework assignents are the property of the AMATH 482 at the University of Washington.
